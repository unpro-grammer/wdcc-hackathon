### Problem statement

After the Earth was lost to an earth-shattering explosion, human life must begin anew in the extraterrestrial realm. To reminisce about the fond memories of homely comforts, as well as connect with a foreign lifestyle, SpaceBites brings its users a selection of Earth-based, local, and interstellar dishes.

## Functions

- Search for restaurants
- Filter by dietary requirements
- Modify items in cart

(Currently, McGalaxy has a full menu list.)
